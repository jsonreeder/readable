_A React/Redux practice project_

I made this project as part of the Udacity React Nanodegree. It is designed after the pattern of aggregators like Reddit and allows the following functionality:
- Categories
  - View all posts in a given category
  - Sort posts in that category by votes or date submitted
- Posts
  - View a post detail page, with all comments for that post
  - Add a new post
  - Edit an existing post
  - Delete a post
- Comments
  - Add a new comment
  - Edit an existing comment
  - Delete a comment

## Technology used

- React
- Redux
- React Router
- Bulma (styling)
- Prettier (formatting)

  - `cd api-server`
  - `npm install`

- In another terminal window, run the frontend
